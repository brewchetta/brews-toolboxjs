# toolboxjs

This little toolbox has reusable code for different projects. No, they aren't yet highly developed or efficient algorithms but I like them anyhow. This is mostly for me to add code to other projects but it's obviously available for anyone to copy and use.

### numWord()

This takes in a positive integer and spits out the corresponding word. For example: 
```numWord(1) => "one"```

### nthNumber()

Similar to numWord(), nthNumber() takes in a positive integer and spits out the word in its nth form, for example: 
```nthNumber(10) => "tenth"```
