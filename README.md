# Brew's Toolbox.js

This little toolbox has reusable code for different projects. No, they aren't yet highly developed or efficient algorithms but I like them anyhow. This is mostly for me to add code to other projects but it's obviously available for anyone to copy and use.

### capitalizeWords()
Takes in a word or words and returns them capitalized. For example:

```capitalizeWords("good morning") => Good Morning```

### isALetter()

A really simple one that returns true or false if the string is a single letter or not. For example:

```isALetter("a") => true```

### isAConsonant()

Uses isALetter and checks to see whether that letter is a consonant. For example:

```isAConsonant("a") => false```

```isAConsonant("b") => true```

### isAVowel()

Uses isALetter and checks to see whether that letter is a vowel. For example:

```isAConsonant("a") => true```

```isAConsonant("b") => false```

### numWord()

This takes in a positive integer and spits out the corresponding word. For example:

```numWord(1) => "one"```

### nthNumWord()

Similar to numWord(), nthNumWord() takes in a positive integer and spits out the word in its nth form, for example:

```nthNumWord(10) => "tenth"```

### random()

Takes in an array or an object and returns a random element from it. For example:

```random([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) => 2```

```random([1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c", 4: "d", 5: "e"]) => {3: "c"}```

Many of these functions have been built to render error messages on the console if an incorrect argument gets passed in, however they won't throw errors themselves.
